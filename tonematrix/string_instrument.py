"""Part 2: a simulated plucked string (Karplus-Strong).

The string is a RingBuffer of displacement samples plus two rules for how
that buffer evolves. You built the buffer in Part 1; here you only use its
public interface.

Rules for this file:
  * All access to the samples goes through enqueue/dequeue/peek. Do not reach
    into self.buffer._data, and do not keep a second copy of the samples.
  * The buffer is created once in __init__ and never replaced.
  * pluck() and next_sample() allocate nothing.
